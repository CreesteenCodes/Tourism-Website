# Mabini Tourismo
This is a simple website about Mabini, Batangas — a popular tourist spot in the Philippines. It shows:
* A home section with a welcome message and background image.
* An attractions section with a picture carousel (slideshow) and info cards about beaches, diving spots, islands, mountains, and resorts.
* A location section with a Google Maps embed to help visitors find Mabini easily.
* A footer with contact info and social media links. <br>

The site is built using:
* HTML → for the page structure.
* CSS → for the design, layout, and styling.
* JavaScript → for interactive features like the mobile menu and image carousel. <br>

It’s responsive, meaning it adjusts well on both desktop and mobile devices.
